    <p>We have example messages from 6 persons in JSON format.</p>
    <p>There are at least 3 persons who are older than 17.</p>
    <p>Using a loop to find out those who are most probably older than 17 years old based on example messages.</p>
    <p>Print their names in the console.</p>
    <p>Note: never change existing code.</p>
